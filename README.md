# Project 1 - Data Modeling for a Music Streaming App called Sparkify.

In this project, I have the role of a Data Engineer at a fabricated data streaming company called “Sparkify”. It is a startup and wants to analyze the data they’ve been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don’t have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

Because of that, my role on this project is to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis.

## Description of the work done

In this project, I’ve applied what I’ve learned on data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. I’ve defined fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus and written an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.
